<p><em>Sunset has truly captivating magic. They seek to see it, to capture it in pictures, photographs, to describe it in words.</p> <p>In the sunset light people communicate in feelings, make suggestions, or simply, without words, sit in an embrace, bowing their heads towards each other.</p> <p>It is a pity that many of us neglect the opportunity to join the contemplation of this real miracle, choosing more ordinary activities.</em></p>

<p>At a time when the heavy, velvety heat of a summer day, like an ocean tide, slowly but irrevocably runs away, everything seems to freeze.</p> <p>The sun, tired of a day of honest and conscientious work, before that, slowly rolling across the horizon, approaching the horizon, as if everything is accelerating.</p> <p>Yellow, blindingly bright in the afternoon, it changes its color and shade to a softer and warmer one, which, like a weightless shawl, covers everything around.</p> <p>For a brief moment, an atmosphere of coziness and peace is created, in which you want to love and be loved.</p>

<b>The ability not only to see the beautiful, but also to appreciate it, is not given to everyone, but all people are born and go through the almost identical process of formation and formation.</b> <b>Of course, the basis for internal growth is different for everyone, but at a certain stage in life, a person begins to correct himself.</b> <b>So why not do it in the right direction: enjoying the eternal and the beautiful? Take a moment of your time and you to admire the summer sunset.</b>
